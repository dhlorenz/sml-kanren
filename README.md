## sml-kanren

An implementation of miniKanren with `===`, `conj`, `disconj`, and
`fresh`. This is mostly written so I can test out some libraries I've
made for ML.

If you want a sense of how the language is layed out, see
`src/kanren.sig`. If you want an example of how to write some fun
programs, see `demo/` or `src/prelude.fun`.
